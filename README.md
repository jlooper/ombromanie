# ðŸ¤š ðŸ¤™ ðŸ‘‹ Ombromanie: Create a Hand Shadow Show using Machine Learning ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ¤™ ðŸ¤š

Hand shadows show, often with simply one candle and one person making shadows in front of a screen or wall, is an ancient Asian art form, popularized in the 18th century in Europe. It's a fun way to entertain yourself and the kids by creating stories on a wall with just your hands.

In this demo, we use TensorFlow.js's HandPose library, which unfortunately right now only allows you to use one hand to project poses to the screen. However you can tell a story, record it, and save it as a local file to send to someone as a gift.
